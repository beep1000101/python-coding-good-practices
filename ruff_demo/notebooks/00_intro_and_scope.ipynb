    "- Why linters exist\n",
    "- Why formatters exist\n",
    "- Why Ruff is the default choice here\n",
    "- Minimal examples demonstrating the impact\n",

    "## Key References\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why PEP 8 Exists\n",
    "- Python community standard for layout, naming, spacing, etc.\n",
    "- Goal: readability, predictability, reduced ambiguity\n",
    "- Improves comprehension for anyone who didn’t write the code\n",
    "- Baseline for automated tooling (linters/formatters)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Linters Exist\n",
    "- Detect mistakes humans shouldn’t waste time spotting:\n",
    "  - unused imports\n",
    "  - undefined names / typos\n",
    "  - unreachable code\n",
    "  - experiment debris\n",
    "  - anti-patterns (mutable defaults, shadowed built-ins)\n",
    "- Cheaper and faster than manual review\n",
    "- Reduce debugging time by catching trivial errors early\n",
    "- In DS workflows, code evolves quickly → easy to accumulate garbage\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Formatters Exist\n",
    "- Code that looks consistent is easier to scan\n",
    "- Eliminates whitespace and formatting debates\n",
    "- Reduces noise in diffs (formatting becomes invisible)\n",
    "- Encourages more logical, focused PR reviews\n",
    "- Zero human effort once enabled (format-on-save)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Why Ruff Specifically\n",
    "- Single tool replaces:\n",
    "  - flake8\n",
    "  - isort\n",
    "  - some black-like formatting\n",
    "  - many plugins\n",
    "- Extremely fast\n",
    "- Already used by other teams here → shared standards\n",
    "- Works seamlessly in VS Code\n",
    "- Can be gradually configured (start light)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Minimal Value Proposition (Core Points)\n",
    "- People read code more than they write it → consistency matters\n",
    "- Linters prevent stupid bugs before runtime\n",
    "- Formatters remove noise and manual style decisions\n",
    "- Ruff applies both automatically\n",
    "- Zero cost after setup\n",
    "- Large payoff in collaboration, review quality, onboarding, and maintenance\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Practical Recommendations\n",
    "- Avoid manual formatting entirely\n",
    "- Treat linting warnings seriously\n",
    "- Fix warnings immediately (don’t accumulate)\n",
    "- Keep config minimal in early phase\n",
    "- Let the tooling set the baseline look\n",

    "## Suggested Progression for Teams\n",
    "1. Enable linting + format-on-save\n",
    "2. Fix issues organically as you work\n",
    "3. Gradually prune ignored rules\n",
    "4. Add minimal `pyproject.toml`\n",
    "5. Later: stricter consistency, type hints, pre-commit hooks\n",

    "# Measuring Impact\n",
    "- Fewer review comments about style\n",
    "- Faster onboarding\n",
    "- Shorter debugging sessions\n",
    "- Cleaner diffs\n",
    "- Higher trust in shared code\n",
    "\n",
    "If even one undefined variable or experiment leftover gets caught per month, the tool already paid for itself."
